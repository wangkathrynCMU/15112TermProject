Poker Face allows poker players to see their readable emotions as they play 
their game, helping them train their "poker face" and also incorporating
computer AI that plays based on their expression. The Design Proposal is in the zip file.

Run 'KathrynTermProject.py' to start game. Issues can arise running with VSCode
with error "zsh:abort" in which case switch to Terminal. 

Dlib detector training data is the file 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat',
which should be placed in the same folder as the code files, as well as all of 
the given images ('heart.png', 'diamond.png', 'spade.jpg', 'club.png', 'poker_table.jpeg').

You can download the training data here: http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
(The training data was too large to upload to autolab.)
